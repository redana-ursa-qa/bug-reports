# bug-reports

This repository contains examples of bug reports created as part of my QA practice.  
The reports demonstrate my skills in documenting defects clearly and consistently, following industry standards (ISTQB).  

Each bug report includes:  

- clear steps to reproduce;  

- expected and actual results;  

- severity and priority of a defect;

- environment details;  

- attachments (screenshots, if needed).
